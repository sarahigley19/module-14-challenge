# module-14-challenge
I was asked to create a tech blog for this assignment. I think I was able to get most of the things done required for this assignment.

##  Project Description
In the end, I learned a lot about this project. I was able to finally get a working login page and be able to create and edit blog posts. I think the design looks good and I am happy with how it came out. I think it met most of the requirments of this assigment and am happy with how it turned out!
